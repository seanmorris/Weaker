# Weaker

[![CI test status](https://github.com/seanmorris/weaker/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/seanmorris/Weaker/actions)

*WeakerMaps are enumerable Maps with with weak values rather than keys.*

*WeakerSets are like WeakSets but are enumerable and clearable.*

## Install
### Both
```bash
npm install weaker
```

```javascript
import { WeakerMap, WeakerSet } from 'weaker';
```

### One or the other
```bash
npm install weakermap
npm install weakerset
```

```javascript
import { WeakerMap } from 'weakermap';
import { WeakerSet } from 'weakerset';
```

### WeakerMap
This class implements a pattern similar to the 'WeakMap', however its *values* are weakly referenced, rather than the keys. This allows for enumeration, clearing and arbitrarily valued keys, with the limitation that the *values* must be objects. Note that elements may not be garbage collected immediately upon leaving a given scope, however this should not have an impact on memory, since the memory will not be freed until the garbage collector runs, with or without the `WeakerMap`. See [MDN's notes on WeakRefs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakRef#notes_on_weakrefs) for more info.

### WeakerSet
This class implements a pattern similar to the `WeakSet`, but allows for enumeration and clearing. Ironically, the implementation depends on a `WeakerMap` and a `WeakMap` in tandem, managing a group of `WeakRefs`. Note that elements may not be garbage collected immediately upon leaving a given scope, however this should not have an impact on memory, since the memory will not be freed until the garbage collector runs, with or without the `WeakerSet`. See [MDN's notes on WeakRefs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakRef#notes_on_weakrefs) for more info.

## Examples
### WeakerMap
A `WeakerMap` will only hold onto its values as long as they aren't garbage collected. Once that happens, they will be removed without any further intervention from the programmer.

#### Cache Example

A `WeakerMap` can be used to cache `fetch()` requests by URL:

```javascript
import { WeakerMap } from 'weakermap';

const cache = new WeakerMap();

async function fetchWithCache(url) {
    // Check if the response is already in the cache
    if (cache.has(url)) {
        console.log('Cache hit for:', url);
        return cache.get(url);
    }

    console.log('Cache miss for:', url);

    // Fetch the data and store it in the cache
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();

    // Store the fetched data in the cache
    cache.set(url, data);

    return data;
}

// Example usage
(async () => {
    try {
        const url1 = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1';
        const url2 = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2';

        // Fetch data with caching
        console.time('Request 1');
        const data1 = await fetchWithCache(url1);
        console.log('Data from url1:', data1);
        console.timeEnd('Request 1');

        console.time('Request 2');
        const data2 = await fetchWithCache(url2);
        console.log('Data from url2:', data2);
        console.timeEnd('Request 2');

        // Fetch again to demonstrate cache hit
        console.time('Request 3');
        const data1Again = await fetchWithCache(url1);
        console.log('Data from url1 again:', data1Again);
        console.timeEnd('Request 3');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    }
})();
```

#### Memory Usage:

‚ö†Ô∏è *NOTE* ‚ö†Ô∏è: The following example makes use of `global.gc()` to force garbage collection to run regardless of existing heuristics. This requires node to be run with the `--expose-gc` flag. This is not necessary except to demonstrate the behavior in a short script, where the garbage collector would not normally run until the program exits.

```javascript
import { WeakerMap } from 'weaker/WeakerMap';

const wm = new WeakerMap;
const retain  = [];

{
    let a = {a:1}, b = {b:2}, c = {c:3};

    [ ['a', a], ['b', b], ['c', c] ].forEach(e => wm.set(...e));

    retain.push(b,c);
};

const printRemaining = () => {
    retain;       // keep refs in-scope
    global.gc();  // force the garbage collector
    console.log(wm.values());
};

printRemaining();
// The garbage collector hasn't run yet,
// so we still have all three refs
// [ { a: 1 }, { b: 2 }, { c: 3 } ]

setTimeout(printRemaining, 500);
// Once we swap to a new 'job', it can run
// and we only have two objects now
// [ { b: 2 }, { c: 3 } ]
```
